####website building exercise for Epicodus, 01.29.2016
###By Jacob Steinberg
##Description
This is a website I created for my fourth code review. Its main function is to, when given specific inputs for a type of pizza, display the estimated cost of said pizza. This web site is an exercise in HTML, Javascript and jquery, specifically in using object constructors and prototypes.
##Program Setup Instructions
navigate to the site, select the type of pizza you want to order, hit enter, and you will see the pizza price.
